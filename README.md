# Free Nominet Right Of Registration EPP Software

# What is the .uk Right Of Registration?
https://registrars.nominet.uk/namespace/uk/uk-rights-registration

# Documentation

Documentation is available in the *DOCUMENTATION.md* file.

Please be aware, I make no promises this is going to be successful for you, but the functionality will work. You could also turn this into a drop catching script pretty easily too.

# Why release this for free?

Every registrar should have access to software (in my opinion for free) to be able to attempt to register their desired names over the release period, Nominet haven't provided it's registrars with the tools so someone had to.

Please feel free to create "Issues" with any desired features prior to release

# Potential features pre launch

- Ability to change the amount of requests
- Better logging

# Testing

This can be tested at any time by loading an obscure list of .uk domains that aren't registered, it will run as expected on the minute after you start the script.

# Donations

I don't expect anything in return for this but it's there if you are feeling generous.
